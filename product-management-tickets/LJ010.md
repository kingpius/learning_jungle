## 🎟️ Product Ticket: LJ-010 — MS3 Compliance Alignment (Docs + Navigation + Template Consistency)

---

### 📌 Ticket ID

LJ-010

---

### 🧑‍💼 Ownership & Roles

* **Primary Owner (Full Stack Engineer):** Full Stack Engineer
* **Product Manager:** PM (scope control, acceptance)
* **Test Owner:** Test Engineer (smoke + regression)
* **Design Owner:** Optional (light QA only)

---

### 🎯 Objective

Bring the Learning Jungle MVP into full alignment with `product-management-tickets/MS3-project.md` mandatory requirements by addressing missing documentation, navigation/layout consistency, and broken/incomplete templates.

This is a **compliance + usability pass** only (no new product features).

---

### 🧩 In Scope

1. **Documentation (MS3 #6, #8)**
   - Add root `README.md` describing:
     - what the project is and value to users
     - main features (parent auth, child CRUD, diagnostic flow, treasure/rank)
     - local setup/run instructions
     - deployment URL + basic runbook pointer
     - external dependencies/services used (Django, WhiteNoise, Gunicorn, Gemini/AI) and attribution notes
   - Add explicit attribution section (libraries + any tutorial-derived patterns if applicable).

2. **Main navigation + structured layout (MS3 #5)**
   - Add a minimal top navigation bar to `core/templates/base.html`:
     - Home
     - Parent Login/Register (if logged out)
     - Logout (if logged in)
     - Children
     - Start Diagnostic (or link to child list, then start)
     - (Optional) Design System (internal link)
   - Ensure primary pages extend `base.html` so navigation is always present.

3. **Template consistency (MS3 #4, #5)**
   - Update `accounts/templates/accounts/login.html` and `accounts/templates/accounts/register.html` to extend `base.html` and use the design system classes for readability.
   - Update `children/templates/children/*.html` to extend `base.html` (remove standalone HTML shells) and keep layout consistent.

4. **Broken rewards template fix**
   - Create `rewards/templates/rewards/create.html` (currently missing) and ensure the route `/rewards/create/<uuid:child_id>/` renders successfully with basic UX.
   - Confirm rewards flow does not break navigation and respects parent ownership (already enforced in view).

5. **Secrets safety quick audit (MS3 #10)**
   - Verify no committed secrets in repo (e.g., remove hardcoded `SECRET_KEY` dev default if still present or ensure it’s clearly dev-only and overridden in prod).
   - Confirm `.env` is ignored and document required env vars in `README.md` (names only).

---

### 🚫 Out of Scope (Explicitly Excluded)

* New product features (beyond navigation/docs/template wiring)
* Visual redesign or new design system components
* CI/CD pipelines
* Performance work beyond basic hygiene

---

### 🧠 Functional Requirements

1. **Homepage usability**
   - New visitors can discover how to log in/register from the homepage via navigation and/or clear CTA.

2. **CRUD discoverability**
   - Logged-in parents can reach children list and create/edit/delete child profiles via navigation.

3. **Rewards page renders**
   - `/rewards/create/<child_id>/` renders without template errors and provides a basic form.

4. **Documentation complete**
   - Root `README.md` present and contains MS3-required content + attribution.

---

### 🧪 Acceptance Criteria

| Scenario | Expected Result |
| --- | --- |
| Repo has root README | `README.md` exists and explains project + setup + deployment |
| Attribution documented | README contains dependencies/attribution section |
| Main nav visible | All core screens show a nav and consistent layout |
| Auth screens styled | Login/register use `base.html` and are readable |
| Child CRUD usable | Child list/create/edit/delete all work and link properly |
| Rewards create renders | Rewards create page loads and submits without template error |
| No secrets committed | Secrets remain in env vars only; `.env` not tracked |

---

### 🏁 Definition of Done

* `README.md` added at repo root
* Navigation added to `core/templates/base.html`
* Accounts + children templates extend `base.html`
* Rewards create template added and verified
* Smoke test checklist completed by Test Engineer

### 🚦 Priority

P0 — Compliance / assessment readiness

### 🔄 Updates & Coordination Log

**Update YYYY-MM-DD — PM**
- (Add scope clarifications and sign-off here.)

**Update 2025-12-17 — Full Stack Engineer**
- Added root `README.md` with MS3-required project description, setup, env var names, and attribution.
- Added global navigation to `core/templates/base.html` and rewired auth + child templates to extend `base.html` for consistent layout.
- Fixed rewards create flow by adding missing template `rewards/templates/rewards/create.html` and correcting URL param type to UUID.
- Hygiene: removed hardcoded production-like secret fallback in `config/settings.py` (now requires `SECRET_KEY` in production).
- Validation: `./venv/bin/python manage.py test` (30 tests, all pass).
